## Overview

### The challenge

  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- HTML5 form validation
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- CSS Media queries
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JS

### Continued development

The project required 2 breakpoints (375px & 1440px). I could rewrite CSS to create smoother breakpoints or add more media queries to make the site more fluid. Another exciting approach would be to use CSS pre-processors or JS libraries / frameworks to recreate the content.
